Monopoly bidding system

Designed for an alternate game start setup. Ideally, a game should begin with
each player having a fair chance to buy property, without the roll of the dice
getting in the way.

This system is, in effect, a mass auction. Each player starts with the same
amount of money (and that amount can be easily tweaked; feel free to limit the
players to spending only $1000 and having to start with $500 cash, or other
patterns), which can be bid on any property. Minimum bid is the face value of
the lot.
