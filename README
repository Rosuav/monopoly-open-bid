Monopoly bidding system

Designed for an alternate game start setup. Ideally, a game should begin with
each player having a fair chance to buy property, without the roll of the dice
getting in the way.

This system is, in effect, a mass auction. Each player starts with the same
amount of money (and that amount can be easily tweaked; feel free to limit the
players to spending only $1000 and having to start with $500 cash, or other
patterns), which can be bid on any property. Minimum bid is the face value of
the lot.

All bids are immediate and binding, until such time as you are outbid. There
is currently no system for retracting an accidental bid, so take care. You will
never be able to relinquish an unwanted property in order to bid higher on a
contested one, so bid conservatively. (And remember that outbidding someone
*else* gives them money to spend elsewhere...)

There is currently no authentication system, just user names.

This project has been an excellent test of things almost unrelated to its
purported purpose, so why not continue? The lets-go-lindt branch explores the
impact of removing React.js in favour of the Chocolate Factory, using the Lindt
style for maximum similarity.

Steps to transform:

1. To simplify the comparison, keep the client/* tree broadly structured the
   same way. We can even cling to the Redux state-management style, just for
   the sake of parallelism.
2. Remove package.json, .babelrc, webpack.config.js
3. Update the notes in heroku.txt to remove most of the complexity, testing
   all the way.
