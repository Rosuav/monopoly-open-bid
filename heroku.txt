In case Heroku does not correctly detect the buildpack to use (shouldn't be a
problem now that Node and React are gone), force it thus:

heroku create monopoly-open-bid
heroku buildpacks:set heroku/python
heroku ps:scale web=1
heroku config:set WS_KEEPALIVE=1

Sadly, Heroku seems to kick websockets that go idle, breaking the whole point
of the app (and of websockets, I think!). So I have to implement a keep-alive.
It's configured via the environment (hence the last command).
