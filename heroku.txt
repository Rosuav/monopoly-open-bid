Setting up for Heroku deployment is slightly complicated, as this involves
both npm and pip as package managers (due to the React front end and Python
back end).

heroku create monopoly-open-bid
heroku buildpacks:set heroku/python
heroku buildpacks:add --index 1 heroku/nodejs
heroku ps:scale web=1

Sadly, Heroku seems to kick websockets that go idle, breaking the whole point
of the app (and of websockets, I think!). So I have to implement a keep-alive.
